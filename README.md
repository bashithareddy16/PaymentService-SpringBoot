I have developed a Java microservices project called PaymentService using the Spring Boot framework. The primary objective of this project is to efficiently handle API requests for placing orders, providing a seamless and reliable experience for users.

I have developed PaymentService using Spring Framework.

I have implemented separate APIs for different functionalities: for example doPayment when an order is placed using OrderService component.

In this project, the Service Registry (Eureka Server) is utilized to facilitate the connection of OrderService.

I have verified the functionality of these APIs by testing them with Postman, ensuring that they respond correctly. To persist the data, I have integrated a MySQL database into the project. The database stores the necessary information related to products and orders, allowing for efficient data management and retrieval.
